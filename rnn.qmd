# 🔁 RNN Basics

RNNs are the foundation of LSTMs. They have loops in their architecture that allow information to persist.

# 🧪 Simple RNN in PyTorch

```{python}
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=1)
x = torch.randn(5, 3, 10)
h0 = torch.randn(1, 3, 20)
out, hn = rnn(x, h0)
out.shape
```
